# 1. A local small gym is looking to incorporate a system which will allow members of the gym to book training sessions with available trainers. It will also allow them to check for available slots and choose which slot suits them best. This system will also facilitate the transactions that will take place. A training session will be R100.00 per session. A session is 60 minutes. Only a member can book a training session. Two or more members can not book the same trainer and the same time slot, but they can book the same trainer on the same day if the time slot is different. The gym is open from 7am to 7pm Monday to Sunday.

A trainee (Member at the gym who is trained by a trainer) books a slot and pays for it on credit. A trainee cannot book a session if he/she does not have enough credit.
